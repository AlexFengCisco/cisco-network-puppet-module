Cisco NXOS Module Review

* excellent use of autorequire
  * can lose resource existence check
* excellent use of title_patterns
  * single var patterns can be elided
* many props could use a default
  * e.g. cisco_interface#svi_autostate?
* many munge functions do validation
* missing onep_lib to run tests
  * relative inclusion of onep_lib from outside
* specs do not match code
  * e.g. cisco_interface#state, #switchport, #element are tested, but do not exist
* providers and types do not match up
  * type cisco_interface_clan has no provider
  * provider cisco_interface_ospf has not type
* Recommend to setup Gemfile
* use rspec-puppet/puppetlabs_spec_helper for test support
  * Rakefile could use better test task, without needing to hardcode spec path
* different styles of providers
  * onep
    * much custom code
  * nxapi from template
    * looks like good solution for types with many properties
    * might profit from even more meta programming to reduce duplicate code
  * nxapi custom
    * e.g. cisco_ospf: very simple provider, would not profit from meta programming complexity
